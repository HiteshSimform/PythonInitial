What is Python?

Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  

Arithmetic operations

Both list.sort() and sorted() have key and reverse optional arguments that can be called on each list element prior to making comparisons23. Use list.sort() when you intend to mutate the list, and the original order is not needed, and use sorted() when you want a new sorted list while preserving the original iterable

Feature	List	Tuple	Set	Dictionary
Mutability	Mutable (modifiable)	Immutable (non-modifiable)	Mutable, elements must be immutable	Mutable; keys immutable, values mutable
Order	Ordered	Ordered	Unordered (no guaranteed order)	Ordered (from Python 3.7+, insertion order)
Duplicates	Allows duplicates	Allows duplicates	Unique elements only	Unique keys, duplicate values allowed
Syntax	[item1, item2]	(item1, item2)	{item1, item2}	{key1: value1, key2: value2}
Use case	Collection of similar items	Collection of different items, order matters	Membership testing, removing duplicates	Key-value pairs for lookup

You have a table with product sales data that includes the day of the week and the original price. 
Implement dynamic pricing: If the sale occurred on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday), increase the price by 10%. Otherwise, 
keep the original price. 
Return product name, sale date, and sale price.
