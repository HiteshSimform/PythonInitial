Your code snippet defines a class `Solution` with a method `findDifferentBinaryString`, but it's incomplete. Hereâ€™s a proper implementation:

### **Problem Explanation**
Given a list of `n` unique binary strings of length `n`, we need to return a binary string of the same length that is **not** in the given list.

### **Optimal Approach**
We can solve this problem using the **Cantorâ€™s Diagonalization Method**:
- Construct a new binary string by picking the **i-th** bit from the **i-th** string in `nums` and flipping it (i.e., `0 â†’ 1` and `1 â†’ 0`).
- This guarantees that the new binary string differs from every given string at least in one position, ensuring uniqueness.

---

### **Implementation**
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        # Apply Cantor's diagonalization technique
        return ''.join('1' if nums[i][i] == '0' else '0' for i in range(len(nums)))
```

---

### **Example**
#### **Input:**
```python
nums = ["01", "10"]
sol = Solution()
print(sol.findDifferentBinaryString(nums))
```
#### **Possible Output:**
```
"00"
```
or
```
"11"
```
Both are valid answers because they are not in `nums`.

---

### **Time Complexity**
- **O(n)**: We iterate through `nums` once (length `n`), flipping bits to construct the new string.

### **Space Complexity**
- **O(1)**: We use only a single string of size `n`, which is negligible extra space.

elaborate it and not do in only one line

Sure! Let's break it down step by step and provide a more detailed implementation.

### **Understanding the Problem**
We are given a list of `n` unique binary strings, each of length `n`. Our goal is to find a new binary string of the same length that is **not** present in the given list.

#### **Example 1**
##### **Input:**
```python
nums = ["01", "10"]
```
##### **Possible Outputs:**
- `"00"`
- `"11"`

Both `"00"` and `"11"` are valid because they do not appear in `nums`.

#### **Example 2**
##### **Input:**
```python
nums = ["111", "011", "001"]
```
##### **Possible Output:**
- `"101"` (or any other unique string)

### **Approach: Cantorâ€™s Diagonalization Method**
Cantor's diagonalization is a mathematical technique used to prove that there are infinitely many unique sequences in a given set. We can use this method to construct a binary string that is guaranteed to be **different** from all given binary strings.

**How it works:**
1. We create a new string by iterating over the given list `nums`.
2. For each index `i`, we look at the `i-th` binary digit of the `i-th` string.
3. We flip that bit (`0 â†’ 1` and `1 â†’ 0`).
4. Since this new string differs from every given string at least at index `i`, it **must** be unique.

This ensures that our answer is **not in the given list** because it is distinct from each element at least in one position.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        """
        Generates a binary string of the same length as the given binary strings,
        ensuring it is not present in the list using Cantorâ€™s diagonalization method.

        :param nums: List of unique binary strings of length n
        :return: A binary string of length n that is not in nums
        """
        n = len(nums)  # Length of each binary string

        # Initialize an empty list to store the new binary string
        result = []

        # Apply diagonalization: Flip the i-th bit of the i-th string
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i][i] == '0':
                result.append('1')  # Flip '0' to '1'
            else:
                result.append('0')  # Flip '1' to '0'

        # Join the list to form the final binary string
        return ''.join(result)
```

---

### **How the Code Works**
1. We get the length of the list `nums`, which is also the length of each binary string.
2. We create an empty list `result` to store our new binary string.
3. We iterate through `nums`, flipping the `i-th` bit of the `i-th` string:
   - If the bit is `'0'`, we change it to `'1'`.
   - If the bit is `'1'`, we change it to `'0'`.
4. We join the flipped bits to form our final binary string.
5. Since the new string is different from each given string at index `i`, it must be unique.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**
Let's go through an example:

#### **Input:**
```python
nums = ["00", "01"]
```
#### **Execution Steps:**
1. `i = 0`: The `0-th` character of `nums[0] = "00"` is `'0'`. We flip it to `'1'`.
2. `i = 1`: The `1-st` character of `nums[1] = "01"` is `'1'`. We flip it to `'0'`.

Final string: `"10"` (which is not in `nums`).

---

### **Time & Space Complexity**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` (since we iterate through the list once).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (since we store the new string in a list before joining).

This approach ensures that we always generate a unique string efficiently. Would you like additional test cases or modifications? ðŸš€
